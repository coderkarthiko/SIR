# SIR-model
The SIR model is a set of differential equations used to model epidemic spread. S is the number of people who are susceptible, I is the number of people who are infected and R is the number of people who are removed - either they died or recovered. We are assuming a closed system - meaning no people are getting into or out of the pandemic zone i.e., S + I + R = constant = N where N is the population of individuals.
